## Suggestions for issues

1. If it is resolved (either for you personally, or in general), please consider closing it.
2. If this might still be an issue, but you are not interested in promoting its resolution, please consider closing it while encouraging others to take over and reopen an issue if they care enough.
3. If you still have interest in resolving it, try to ping somebody who you believe might have an interest in the topic. Consider discussing the problem in [Discord](https://determinate.systems/discord).

**Memorandum on closing issues**

Don't be afraid to close an issue that holds valuable information. Closed issues stay in the system for people to search, read, cross-reference, or even reopen--nothing is lost! Closing obsolete issues is an important way to help maintainers focus their time and effort.
