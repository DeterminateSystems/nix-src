# Uninstalling Nix

To uninstall Determinate Nix, use the uninstallation utility built into the [Determinate Nix Installer][installer]:

```console
$ /nix/nix-installer uninstall
```

If you're certain that you want to uninstall, you can skip the confirmation step:

```console
$ /nix/nix-installer uninstall --no-confirm
```
