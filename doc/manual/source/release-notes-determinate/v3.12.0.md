# Release 3.12.0 (2025-10-23)

* Based on [upstream Nix 2.32.1](../release-notes/rl-2.32.md).

## What's Changed

### `nix nario`

Determinate Nix has a new command, `nix nario`, that replaces the commands `nix-store --export` and `nix-store --import` from the old CLI. `nix nario` allows you to serialize store paths to a file that can be imported into another Nix store. It is backwards compatible with the file format generated by `nix-store --export`. It also provides a new format (selected by passing `--format 2`) that supports store path attributes such as signatures, and allows store paths to be imported more efficiently.

### Other changes

`nix flake clone` now supports arbitrary input types. In particular, this allows you to clone tarball flakes, such as flakes on FlakeHub.

When using `-vv`, Determinate Nix now prints the Nix version. This is useful when diagnosing Nix problems from the debug output of a Nix run.
