# Release 3.16.1 (2026-02-22)

* Based on [upstream Nix 2.33.3](../release-notes/rl-2.33.md).

## What's Changed

### `nix store info` now correctly support `--refresh` and `--offline`

Previously, Nix had a hard-coded TTL of seven days.
Determinate Nix moved that TTL to a new setting `narinfo-cache-meta-ttl` and now `nix store info` respects the `--refresh` and `--offline` flags.

This change makes it possible to freshly validate authenticating to a remote store.

### Corrected `builtins.hashString` behavior under lazy trees

`builtins.hashString` now devirtualizes lazy paths, making the hash result stable.
