# Release 3.11.0 (2025-09-03)

- Based on [upstream Nix 2.31.1](../release-notes/rl-2.31.md).

## What's Changed

### Parallel evaluation

The following commands are now able to evaluate Nix expressions in parallel:

- `nix search`
- `nix flake check`
- `nix flake show`
- `nix eval --json`

This is currently in developer preview, and we'll be turning it on for more users in the coming weeks.
If you would like to try it right away, specify `eval-cores` in your `/etc/nix/nix.custom.conf`:

```ini
eval-cores = 0 # Evaluate across all cores
```

Further, we introduced a new builtin: `builtins.parallel`.
This new builtin allows users to explicitly parallelize evaluation within a Nix expression.

Using this new builtin requires turning on an additional experimental feature:

```ini
extra-experimental-features = parallel-eval
```

Please note that this new builtin is subject to change semantics or even go away during the developer preview.
